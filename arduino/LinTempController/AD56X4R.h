 *	\details Library for controlling a AD5664R, AD5644R, and AD5624R (16, 14, 12 bits)
 *          See http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD5624R_5644R_5664R.pdf
 *          for the datasheet. This library uses a software-emulated MOSI communication scheme but could
 *			easily be extended to use the built-in SPI interface.
